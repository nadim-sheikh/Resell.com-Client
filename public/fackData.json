A single leaf means zooming in (i.e. getting closer to the leaf); the icon with three leaves means using the super wide lens (i.e. capturing more leaves in one shot). Tapping the icons will take you quickly to 3x or 10x zooms, but you can also tap on the numbers that pop up next to them as well",

The Oxygen camera app is the familiar Oppo/Realme one. Shocking, isn't it? It offers AI Scene Enhancement - it's like an advanced HDR mode, which may stack several images to offers even further improvements in the dynamic range, but the most prominent improvement is the higher color saturation.",
